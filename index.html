            <h2>REASON I AM IN ALTSCHOOL</h2>
            <p>I would be lying if I say I am fascinated and intrigued by how the web works, I am just a young man from Nigeria trying to find his way and make a honest living, so like most young folks in this part of the world, I'm putting in the work to equip myself with a skill that would enable me take care of myself and people I hold dear.
            I developed interest in tech earlier this year and I had no clue about how to start and also learning resources to start with. After talking to a couple of people around me that are into tech, I was pointed to youtube videos to kick start my learning journey with, Leon Noel's videos from his second 100Devs cohort to be specific, while I was looking for resources to start with, I followed a few popular tech people on  X, formerly twitter and among them was Hack Sultan, the man always with a mask on, he is the co-founder of Altschool Africa, and that was about the time when the application into the school was open and not a day went by without him talking about how joining the program can be a foundation that grooms people who are looking to get into tech and propel them into having amaking careers, I must say, I actually bought into the vision and fast forward to today, I am an Altschooler on who is ready to take on challenges and is certain this programme would be a foundation towards me achieving my goals.</p>

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>MY GOALS</h2>
            <p>I heard heard stories and seen in real time how tech have turned the life of people around just because they made that decision to pursue a career in tech, they put in the work and they kept their heads down, were resilient and were dedicated, and I have seen the testimonies of previous students of Altschool Africa about how they went ahead to get internships and their lives are beginning to change and I strongly believe that my story would not be any different, I joined this program to learn a marketable skill, one that enables me provide value and in the long run get paid for the value I bring to the table. So help me God, amen!</p>
